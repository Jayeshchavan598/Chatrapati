                <span >Chhatrapati Shivaji  Shahaji Bhosle</span>
                <p>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj ( 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680), was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.
                     Shivaji Maharaj carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire.
                      In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati (emperor) of his realm at Raigad.<br> <br>
                Over the course of his life, Shivaji Maharaj engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, 
                    the Sultanate of Golkonda and the Sultanate of Bijapur, as well as with European colonial powers.
                     Shivaji Maharaj's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy.
                      Shivaji Maharaj established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations.
                       He revived ancient Hindu political traditions and court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi language. <br> <br>
                       Shivaji Maharaj's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death,
                        he began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, 
                        as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.
                 <br> <br>
                <h3>Ancestors:</h3>

                        Shivaji Maharaj was born in family of Maratha family of Bhonsle clan. Shivaji Maharaj's paternal grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was an influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet of "Raja".
                         He was given deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur for military expenses. He was also given Fort Shivneri for his family's residence (c. 1590). <br>
                 <br>
                <h3>Early life:</h3> 
                         Shivaji Maharaj was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar in what is now Pune district. 
                        Scholars disagree on his date of birth. The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating Shivaji Maharaj's birth (Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti).
                        Shivaji Maharaj was named after a local deity, the goddess Shivai.
                         Shivaji Maharaj's father Raje Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates.
                         His mother was Rajmata Jijau, the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed,
                         a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri. <br>
<br>
                        At the time of Shivaji Maharaj's birth, power in Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates: 
                        Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golkonda. Raje Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, 
                        the Adilshah of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small army. <br><br>
                      <h3>Upbringing:</h3>
                      Shivaji Maharaj was devoted to his mother Rajmata Jijau, who was deeply religious. 
                      His studies of the Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, also influenced his lifelong defence of Hindu values.
                       He was deeply interested in religious teachings, and regularly sought the company of Hindu saints.
                        Raje Shahaji, meanwhile had married a second wife, Tuka Bai from the Mohite family. 
                        Having made peace with the Mughals, ceding them six forts, he went to serve the Sultanate of Bijapur. 
                        He moved Shivaji Maharaj and Rajmata Jijau from Shivneri to Pune and left them in the care of his jagir administrator, Dadoji Konddeo,
                       who has been credited with overseeing the education and training of young Shivaji Maharaj. <br> <br>
                       Many of Shivaji Maharaj's comrades, and later a number of his soldiers, came from the Maval region, 
                       including Yesaji Kank, Suryaji Kakade, Baji Pasalkar, Baji Prabhu Deshpande and Tanaji Malusare. Shivaji Maharaj traveled the hills and forests of the Sahyadri range with his Maval friends, 
                       gaining skills and familiarity with the land that would prove useful in his military career. Shivaji Maharaj's independent spirit and his association with the Maval youths did not sit well with Dadoji, 
                       who complained without success to Raje Raje Shahaji. <br> <br>
                       In 1639, Raje Raje Shahaji was stationed at Bangalore, which was conquered from the Nayaks who had taken control after the demise of the Vijayanagara Empire.
                        He was asked to hold and settle the area.
                         Shivaji Maharaj was taken to Bangalore where he, his elder brother Sambhaji, and his half brother Ekoji I were further formally trained. 
                         He married Saibai from the prominent Nimbalkar family in 1640.
                         As early as 1645, the teenage Shivaji Maharaj expressed his concept for Hindavi Swarajya (Indian self-rule), in a letter.
